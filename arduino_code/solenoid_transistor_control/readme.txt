//this code allows for a DAQFactory serial device to be created (slave ID 1, baus rate 9600) using an arduino mega.

//connect solenoid low side through a darlington array to GND, connect darlington base to arduino pin.

//create a series of buttons or a sequence to switch between the valves by creating 16 valve channels in DAQFactory (channels 0 to 15).
